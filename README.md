## Overview
Examining temperature data in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
- The average temperature is relatively the same between June & July in Oahu
- The minmum temperatures are slightly lower in December than in June
- The number of observations are high for both months so we can confident that we have an accurate reporesentation of the weather patterns

## Summary
Overall, the results indidcate that the temperature patterns are relatively consistent in Oahu (in looking at only June and December). Therefore, inital indications show that the surf and ice cream shop business could be sustainable year-round.

For additional validation, I would run a query to look at the precipation patterns from June to December as Oahu could go into a rainy season. I would also examine wind speeds if possible because this could discourage surfing at some points in the year.
